\section{Near log-convexity of 
         $t\mapsto m_{2t}$ and $t\mapsto m_{2t+1}$}
\label{sec:logconvex}
In this section we would like to prove the following
improvement to \autoref{eq:absclaim1}: for all $\eps>0$ 
there exists a $\delta>0$ such that
\begin{align}
m_{t+2}
\ge m_{t}^{1+2/t}\cdot
\min\set{t^{1-\eps}, \ceil{\delta\frac{m_t^{1-2/t}}{m_{t-2}}}},
\quad \forall t \ge 2.
\label{eq:logconv}
\end{align}
%
Recall that in proving \autoref{eq:absclaim1}, 
in line \ref{eq:mutrelax}, we used the relaxation 
$\muti{J}{Z}\ge 0$.
Note that $J$ is uniformly distributed on $[t]$
therefore has $\log t$ bits of entropy and provided
that it is possible to infer $J$ from $Z$ 
(i.e., it is possibly to locate the time reversal we 
have inserted in $Z$)
the $\muti{J}{K}$ term appears to be large enough to 
recover the factor
\begin{align*}
\min\set{t^{1-\eps}, 
  \ceil{\delta\frac{m_t^{1-2/t}}{m_{t-2}}}}.
\end{align*}
Note moreover that intuitively we are able to 
infer $J$ from $Z$ better when 
$\frac{m_t^{1-2/t}}{m_{t-2}}$ is high, 
as in such cases on average for a time step $i\in[t]$ 
and a typical $x\sim X_i$,
the distributions $\dist(X_{i-1}\emid X_i=x)$ and
$\dist(X_{i+1}\emid X_i=x)$ should be far from each other, 
as otherwise we can argue that there should be many $t-2$ 
walks as follows. If $\dist(X_{i-1}\emid X_i=x)$ and
$\dist(X_{i+1}\emid X_i=x)$ are close to each other, 
there should be many $p\in\Omega$ which has high probability
in both
these distributions. Sample such a $p$, and 
attach to it a walk sampled from $X_{-1}X_1\ldots X_{i-1}\emid X_{i-1}=p$ 
and another walk sampled from $X_{i+1}X_{i+2}\ldots X_{t+1}\emid X_{i+1}=p$,
which leads to a length $t-2$ walk returning to the origin.
However if $m_{t-2}$ is low, this should not happen and therefore
$\dist(X_{i-1}\emid X_i=x)$ and
$\dist(X_{i+1}\emid X_i=x)$ on average should be far apart, 
which means that we can notice when we take a step backwards in time
and therefore infer $J$. In particular, \autoref{fig:ex1} 
gives such an example where $m_{t-2}=0$ and we can always
recover $J$ with certainty from a sample from $Z$: whenever we take
a step to the left, it must be that we are at time step $J$.

Given this discussion, a direct approach to proving 
\autoref{eq:logconv} appears to bound 
\begin{align}
\muti{Z}{J}\ge \log \min\set{t^{1-\eps}, 
\ceil{\delta\frac{m_t^{1-2/t}}{m_{t-2}}}}.
\label{eq:hope}
\end{align}
Unfortunately, this approach does not seem to 
work as we demonstrate with an example in the full version of this paper.
The problem here appears to be that we 
fix a single distribution $Z$ to explore the
two cases of \autoref{eq:logconv}. 
In our final approach, we pick different 
distributions depending on the case we would like 
to prove. Namely, if 
$\muti{J}{Z}\ge (1-\eps) \log t$, then carrying 
out the calculations in \autoref{eq:kvk2} through 
\ref{eq:absclaim1} with the assumption 
$\muti{J}{Z}\ge (1-\eps) \log t$, we prove 
the first case, namely $m_{t+2}\ge t^{1-\eps}m_t^{1+2/t}$ 
using the distribution given by $Z$.
If $\muti{J}{Z}< (1-\eps) \log t$ on the other hand, 
we demonstrate two new random variables $W,Y$ which are 
distributed respectively on length $t+2$ and length $t-2$ 
walks so that 
  $\kldiv{W}{F^{t+2}} + \kldiv{Y}{F^{t-2}}\le 
    -2\log S^t(\mu, \nu) - \log \delta$,
which implies that $m_{t-2}m_{t+2}\ge \delta m_t^2$.
While $W$ and $Y$ are constructed by modifying $X$ in 
suitable ways, which is how $Z$ was constructed also,
we do so with the hindsight of 
having inspected what causes $\muti{J}{Z}$ to be smaller
than $(1-\eps)\log t$. It is precisely this adaptivity
which enables this approach to overcome the difficulties
encountered by the one suggested in 
\autoref{eq:hope}.

If $\muti{J}{Z}\ge (1-\eps) \log t$, by plugging this into 
\autoref{eq:mutrelax} and carrying out the 
following calculations, 
we get $m_{t+2} \ge t^{1-\eps}\cdot m_t^{1+2/t}$.
Therefore it remains to show there exists a $\delta>0$
such that assuming $\muti{J}{Z} < (1-\eps) \log t$,
we have
$m_{t+2}m_{t-2}\ge \delta m_t^2$.
To do so, we will demonstrate random variables 
$W$ and $Y$
supported on walks that start from $r\in \OC$
and return to $r$ 
after spending respectively $t+2$ and $t-2$ time 
steps in 
$\Omega$ such that $\kldiv{W}{F^{t+2}} + 
\kldiv{Y}{F^{t-2}}\le -2\log S^t(\mu, \nu) - 
\log \delta$. 
Notice that by \autoref{lem:jensen} this indeed implies
that $m_{t+2}m_{t-2}\ge \delta m_t^2$.
The random variables $W$ and $Y$ will be mixtures of 
$\Theta(t)$ random walks, in particular, they are not 
Markovian in general.

For brevity let us set $\mu_i^x \defeq \dist(X_{i-1}\emid X_i = x)$ and 
$\nu_i^x \defeq \dist(X_{i+1}\emid X_i=x)$.
Let $U$ be the unary encoding of $J$: a length $t$ bit
vector of which only the $J$th coordinate is set.
First we would like to understand 
the contribution of each bit of $U$ to 
$\muti{Z}{J}=\muti{Z}{U}$.
Using the chain rule, we write
\begin{align}
(1-\eps)\log t&>   \muti{U}{Z} \nonumber\\
              &=   \sum_{i=1}^t \muti{U_i}{Z\emid U_{<i}}
                    \label{eq:t1-chain}\\
              &=   \sum_{i=1}^t \frac{t-i+1}{t}
                   \muti{U_i}{Z\emid U_{<i}=0}
                   \label{eq:t1-condition}\\
           &\ge \sum_{i=1}^t \frac{t-i+1}{t}
                \muti{U_i}{Z_iZ_{i+1}\emid U_{<i}=0}
                \label{eq:t1-data}\\
           &=   \sum_{i=1}^t\frac{1}{t}
                \E_{x\sim X_i}\kldiv{\mu_i^x}
                {\lambda_i \mu_i^x + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i}
                \nonumber\\
           &\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad
                + \sum_{i=1}^t\frac{t-i}{t}
                \E_{x\sim X_i}\kldiv{\nu_i^x} 
                {\lambda_i\mu_i^x + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i}
                \label{eq:t1-split}
\end{align}
where we set $\lambda_i \defeq 1/(t-i+1)$, which is
the probability that $U_i=1\emid U_{<i}=0$.
Here, \autoref{eq:t1-chain} follows from the 
chain rule, \autoref{eq:t1-condition} is 
true because if $U_{<i}\neq 0$ then $U_i=0$ 
(as $U$ has a single coordinate that is one) 
and consequently the mutual information is
zero, and \autoref{eq:t1-data} is the data 
processing inequality. Next we lower bound 
\autoref{eq:t1-split} by its first term 
(which is valid since $\mu^x_i, \nu^x_i$ 
are distributions hence the second term of 
\autoref{eq:t1-split} is nonnegative), obtaining
\begin{align}
       (1-\eps) \log t &> \E_{i\sim J}\E_{x\sim X_i}
                \kldiv{\mu_i^x}
                      {\lambda_i \mu_i^x 
                      + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i}\,.
                \label{eq:mut-inf}
\end{align}

To simplify the presentation, here we only 
provide the proof of \autoref{thm:main} for 
$\eps >7/8$ which demonstrates the ideas in 
their simplest form. This bound already implies all 
our results in complexity theory, with a constant
factor loss of no more than 8.
The proof for any $\eps>0$ can be found in the 
full version of this paper.

\subsection{The bound for $\eps> 7/8$}
If we condition on the event $i\in\set{1,\ldots,\lceil t/2 \rceil}$, this expectation
increases by a factor of at most 2; namely
\begin{align*}
\E_{i\sim \sparen{t/2}}
  \E_{x\sim X_i}
      \kldiv{\mu_i^x}
      {\lambda_i \mu_i^x 
          + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i} < 2(1-\eps)\log t.
\end{align*}
By Markov's inequality
\begin{align*}
\Pr_{i\sim\sparen{t/2},x\sim X_i}
  \sparen{\kldiv{\mu_i^x}
      {\lambda_i \mu_i^x 
          + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i} \ge 8(1-\eps)\log t} < 1/4,
\end{align*}
so it follows that there is a set 
$T\subseteq\sparen{\lceil t/2\rceil}$ of size
at least $\floor{t/4}$ such that if $i\in T$ we have
\begin{align}
\Pr_{x\sim X_i}
  \sparen{\kldiv{\mu_i^x}
      {\lambda_i \mu_i^x 
          + (1-\lambda_i)\nu_i^x} \ge 8(1-\eps)\log t} < 1/2.
          \label{eq:halfp}
\end{align}
For each $i\in T$ let $X'_i$ be the random variable 
obtained from $X_i$ by conditioning on those 
$x\in \supp(X_i)$ satisfying $\kldiv{\mu_i^x}
{\lambda_i \mu_i^x + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i}<8(1-\eps)\log t$.
Furthermore, for each $i\in T$ and $x\in\supp(X'_i)$,
we construct distributions
$\pi_i^x\colon \Omega\to\realspos$ to be specified later.
Let $P_i$ be sampled by $x\sim X'_i$ first and then picking
$p\sim \pi_i^x$. 

\subsection{The distributions $W$ and $Y$}
Let $K$ be an integer sampled uniformly at
random from the set $T$ (constructed in 
the previous section).
For each fixing $k$ of $K$, the random variables $W\emid K=k$
and $Y\emid K=k$ are random walks 
(i.e., they are Markovian) 
constructed as follows. We first pick $x,p\sim X'_kP_k$.
The walk $Y\emid K=k$ is generated by concatenating a sample
from $X_{-1}X_0\ldots X_{k-1}\emid X_{k-1} = p$ and 
an independent sample from $X_{k+1}\ldots X_{t+1}\emid X_{k+1} = p$.
The walk $W$ is generated by concatenating a sample from 
$X_{-1}X_0\ldots X_{k}\emid X_{k} = x$, the path
$(x, p)$ and $(p,x')$ for an independent sample 
$x'\sim\nparen{X'_k\emid P_k = p}$ and 
an independent sample from $X_{k}\ldots X_{t+1}\emid X_{k} = x'$.

For $k\in T$ we define another random walk 
$\check{X}^k = 
(\check{X}^k_{-1},\ldots,\check{X}^k_{t+1})$, 
only to be used in the analysis of
$W$ and $Y$. We sample $x\sim X'_k$
and set $\check{X}^k_k = x$. We pick the rest of the coordinates of $\check{X}^k$ according to the distribution $X\emid X_k = x$. Note that for any $k\in T$, we have
\begin{align*}
\kldivs{\check{X}^k}{X} = \kldiv{X'_k}{X_k}\le 1
\end{align*} by \autoref{eq:halfp}
and \autoref{lem:klcond} and the fact that both $X$ and 
$\check{X}^k$ are Markovian.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:wy}
We have
\begin{align*}
\kldiv{W\emid K=k}{F^{t+2}} +& \kldiv{Y\emid K=k}{F^{t-2}}\\
&\le -2\log S^t(\mu,\nu) + 2 + \E_{x\sim X'_k}\kldiv{\pi_k^x}{\mu_k^x} + 
        \E_{x\sim X'_k}\kldiv{\pi_k^x}{\nu_k^x}.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We have
\begin{align*}
\kldiv{W\emid K = k}{F^{t+2}} &= \kldivs{\check{X}^k}{F^t} + 
  \kldiv{P_k\emid X'_k}{F_{k+1}\emid F_{k}}
  +\kldiv{X'_k\emid P_k}{F_{k+1}\emid F_{k}}
\end{align*}
and further
\begin{align*}
\kldiv{Y\emid K = k}{F^{t-2}} +& 
  \kldiv{P_k\emid X'_k}{F_{k+1}\emid F_{k}}
  +\kldiv{X'_k\emid P_k}{F_{k+1}\emid F_{k}}
  \\&= \kldivs{\check{X}^k}{F^t}+\E_{x\sim X'_k}
      \kldiv{\pi_k^x}{\mu_k^x} + 
      \E_{x\sim X'_k}\kldiv{\pi_k^x}{\nu_k^x}.
\end{align*}
Summing up the two inequalities and substituting 
$\kldivs{\check{X}^k}{X}\le 1$ we get the result.
\end{proof}
At this point, in light of \autoref{lem:wy},
we could pick each $\pi_k^x$ so that it minimizes
$\kldiv{\pi_k^x}{\mu_k^x} + \kldiv{\pi_k^x}{\nu_k^x}$:
the unique minimizer is given by 
$\pi_k^x = \sqrt{\mu_k^x\nu_k^x} / 
\iprod{\sqrt{\mu_k^x}}{\sqrt{\nu_k^x}}$. 
However doing so leads to $W,Y$ which 
diverge from the $F$ walk by more than a constant,
and therefore is not good enough for our needs.
To obtain better random variables $W$ and $Y$, 
we crucially use the fact that 
$W$ is a mixture of $\Theta(t)$ random walks. Namely, if
we consider the entropy coming from the $\muti{W}{K}$ term
also, a better strategy for picking the distributions 
$\pi_k^x$ becomes available.
By contrast, we do not use the fact that $Y$ is a mixture
and, in fact, it can be replaced by $Y\emid K=k_0$ where
$k_0 = \arg\min_k\kldiv{Y\emid K = k}{F^{t-2}}$, however
the averaged quantity $\kldiv{Y\emid K}{F^{t-2}}$ is
far more convenient to work with.

\subsection{The contribution of $\muti{K}{W}$}
Similar to \autoref{eq:mut-inf}, we would like to understand
the contribution of each time step $t\in T$ to 
$\muti{K}{W}$. Let $V$ be the unary encoding of $K$:
a length $t$ bit vector of which only the $V$th 
coordinate is set. Using the chain rule for 
mutual information
\begin{align*}
\muti{W}{V} &=   \sum_{i\in T}\muti{V_i}{W\emid V_{<i}}\\
            &\ge \E_{k\sim K} \E_{x\sim X'_k} 
                 \kldiv{\pi_k^x}
           {\eta_i \pi_k^x + (1-\eta_i)\widetilde{v}_k^x},
\end{align*}
where $\eta_k = 1/\rank_{T}(k)$ and 
$\widetilde{v}_k^x 
    \defeq \E_{j > k : j\in T} 
    \dist(\check{X}^j_{k+1}\emid \check{X}^j_k = x)$.
Here $\rank_T(i)$ denotes the position of 
$i\in T$ when the elements of $T$ are sorted in decreasing order.
By \autoref{eq:halfp}, and the definition of
$X'_k$, we have
$\widetilde{v}_k^x(y)\le 2\nu_k^x(y)$ for all $y\in \Omega$.
Therefore we conclude that 
\begin{align}
\muti{W}{K} \ge \E_{k\sim K} \E_{x\sim X'_k} 
                 \kldiv{\pi_k^x}
           {\eta_k \pi_k^x + 2(1-\eta_k)\nu_k^x}.\label{eq:muti-nu}
\end{align}
Note in the above divergence expression the 
reference measure is not a probability distribution, 
which our definition permits (cf.\ \autoref{eq:kldiv}).

Recall our goal in this section is to upper bound 
$\kldiv{W}{F^{t+2}} + \kldiv{Y}{F^{t-2}} 
+ 2\log S^t(\mu, \nu)$ by $\log 1/\delta$. 
Let us write
\begin{align}
\kldiv{W}{F^{t+2}} +& \kldiv{Y}{F^{t-2}} 
+ 2\log S^t(\mu, \nu) \nonumber \\
&\le \kldiv{W\emid K}{F^{t+2}} 
  + \kldiv{Y\emid K}{F^{t-2}} 
  - \muti{K}{W} + 2\log S^t(\mu, \nu)
    \nonumber\\
&\le 2 + \E_{k\sim K, x\sim X'_k}
  \kldiv{\pi^k_x}{\mu^k_x} + 
  \kldiv{\pi^k_x}{\nu^k_x} - \muti{K}{W}
        \nonumber\\
&\le 2 + \E_{k\sim K, x\sim X'_k} \E_{y\sim \pi_k^x} \log
\frac{\eta_k \pi_k^x(y)^2 + 2(1-\eta_k)\nu_k^x(y)\pi_k^x(y)}
{\mu_k^x(y)\nu_k^x(y)}\label{eq:div-min},
\end{align}
where the second inequality follows from 
\autoref{lem:wy} and the last inequality is 
obtained by plugging in \autoref{eq:muti-nu}.
Note that the function $z\mapsto z \log(az^2 + bz)$ is 
strictly convex
in $\realspos$ whenever $ab > 0$, therefore 
for each $k,x$ there is a unique minimizer $(\pi_k^x)^*$
of \autoref{eq:div-min},
which can be calculated, say, using Lagrange multipliers. 
However, instead of the minimizer, we work with a simple approximation of it.
For each $k\in T$ and $x\in \supp(X'_k)$, we let
\begin{align*}
\Psi_k^x \defeq \setbuilder{y\in\Omega}
{\nu_k^x(y)\ge \frac{\lambda_k}{1-\lambda_k}\mu_k^x(y)}.
\end{align*}
By definition of $X'_k$, we have
$\kldiv{\mu_i^x}
      {\lambda_i \mu_i^x 
          + (1-\lambda_i)\nu^x_i} < 8(1-\eps)\log t$.
Let $\gamma = 1- 8(1-\eps)$, which is positive by our assumption
$\eps>7/8$.
By Markov's inequality, and the fact that 
$\lambda_k \le 2/t$,
we get
\begin{align*}
\mu_k^x(\Psi_k^x)\ge \gamma
\end{align*}
for large enough $t$.
Let $\pi_k^x$ be $\mu_k^x \emid \Psi_k^x$, namely we have
$\pi_k^x(y) = \mu_k^x(y) / \mu_k^x(\Psi_k^x)$ if 
$y\in\Psi_k^x$, and $\pi_k^x(y) = 0$ otherwise.
Continuing from \autoref{eq:div-min}, we have
\begin{align}
 &\le 2 +  \E_{k\sim K, x\sim X'_k} \E_{y\sim \pi_k^x} \log
\frac{\eta_k \pi_k^x(y)^2 + 2(1-\eta_k)\nu_k^x(y)\pi_k^x(y)}
{\mu_k^x(y)\nu_k^x(y)}\nonumber\\
 &\le 2+ 
 \E_{k\sim K} \log
\nparen{\frac{\eta_k(1-\lambda_k)}{\lambda_k \gamma^2}+\frac{2}{\gamma}},
\label{eq:setsh}
\end{align}
where the second inequality is true by definition of
$\Psi^x_k$ and $\pi^x_k$. 
Now we argue that the expectation term in \autoref{eq:setsh} is maximized
when $T$ is the set containing the smallest $|T|$ elements of 
$[\ceil{t/2}]$. To see this suppose there is an $i\notin T$
which is smaller than the maximum element of $T$.
Let $j$ be the smallest item in $T$ which is greater than $i$. 
We see that the expectation term
increases if we replace $T$ by $T\setminus\set{j}\cup\set{i}$
as $\log\nparen{\frac{C(1-\lambda_k)}
{\lambda_k \gamma^2}+\frac{2}{\gamma}}$ is decreasing in $k$ 
and the ranks
do not change after swapping $j$ with $i$.
Therefore, 
\begin{align}
\kldiv{W}{F^{t+2}} + &\kldiv{Y}{F^{t-2}} + 2\log S^t(\mu, \nu)
\nonumber \\
&\le 2+
\log\nparen{\prod_{i=1}^{|T|}\frac{t/2 + 3i}{i \gamma^2}}^{1/|T|}
\nonumber \\
&=\log\frac{12}{\gamma^2} + 
\log\nparen{\prod_{i=1}^{|T|}\frac{t/6 + i}{i}}^{1/|T|}
\nonumber \\
&\le \log\frac{12}{\gamma^2} + \log\binom{2|T|}{|T|}^{1/|T|}
\label{eq:binomub}\\
&\le \log\frac{48}{\gamma^2},
\end{align}
where the $\binom{2|T|}{|T|}$ is the middle binomial coefficient,
in the second inequality we use the fact $|T|>t/6$,
and the last inequality is true as $\smash{\binom{2n}{n}< 2^{2n}}$.
Therefore it is enough to choose $\eps > 7/8$ and 
$\delta\le \frac{\nparen{1-8(1-\eps)}^2}{48} = \frac{4}{3}(\eps- \sfrac{7}{8})^2$. We have established
the following.
